# Super Bank

This program simulates a bank account, allowing the user to make "withdrawals" and "deposits."
The program displays the balance, any withdrawals/deposits, and any fees assessed in a ledger.

* The account starts with an initial balance of $1000.
* Deposits and/or withdrawals can be made.
* For every deposit over $500, the bank chips in $25.
* The account has $750 of overdraft protection.
* Each withdrawal that sends the balance negative adds a charge of $50 to the account.
* If the account goes below -$750, the account is closed.
